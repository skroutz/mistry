mistry
====================================
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/skroutz/mistry.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skroutz/mistry)

*mistry* executes user-provided jobs inside pre-defined, isolated
environments and makes the results available for later consumption.

*mistry* enables fast workflows by employing caching techniques and incremental
builds due to its copy-on-write snapshotting features.

Features include:

- running arbitrary commands inside isolated environments (provided as Docker images)
- build caching & incremental building (see [*"Build cache"*](https://github.com/skroutz/mistry/wiki/Build-cache))
- a simple JSON API for interacting with the server (scheduling jobs etc.)
- a web view for inspecting the progress of builds (see [*"Web view"*](#web-view))
- efficient use of disk space due to copy-on-write semantics (using [Btrfs snapshotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs#Subvolumes_and_snapshots))

Status
-------------------------------------------------
mistry project is still in alpha and is not yet recommended for use in
production environments until we reach the 1.x series.






Getting started
-------------------------------------------------
You can get the binaries from the
[latest releases](https://github.com/skroutz/mistry/releases).

Alternatively, if you have Go 1.9 or later you can get the
latest development version:

```shell
# server
$ go get -u github.com/skroutz/mistry/cmd/mistryd

# client
$ go get -u github.com/skroutz/mistry/cmd/mistry
```





Usage
--------------------------------------------------
To boot the server, a configuration file is needed:

```shell
$ mistryd --config config.json
```

You can use [`config.sample.json`](cmd/mistryd/config.sample.json)
as a starting point.

The paths denoted by `projects_path` and `build_path` settings should already
be created and writable.

Use `mistryd --help` for more info.




### Adding projects

The `projects_path` path should contain all the projects known to mistry.
These are the projects for which jobs can be built.

Refer to [File system layout - Projects directory](https://github.com/skroutz/mistry/wiki/File-system-layout#projects-directory) for more info.






### API

Interacting with mistry is done in two ways: (1) using `mistry` or (2)
using the JSON API directly. We recommended using `mistry` whenever possible
(although it may occassionally lag behind the server in terms of
supported features).

#### Client

##### Schedule a new job, wait for completion, and fetch the artifacts

```sh
$ mistry build --project foo --target .
```
This will place the artifacts and the target directory.

##### Schedule a new job without waiting

```sh
$ mistry build --project foo --async
```

See `mistry build -h` for more options.

#### HTTP Endpoints

##### Schedule a new job

```sh
$ curl -X POST /jobs \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"project": "foo"}' 
```

```js
{
    "Params": {"foo": "xzv"}, 
    "Path": "<artifact path>",
    "Cached": true,
    "Coalesced": false,
    "ExitCode": 0,
    "Err": null,
    "TransportMethod": "rsync"
}
```


### Web view

*mistry* comes with a web view where progress and logs of each job can be
inspected.

Browse to http://0.0.0.0:8462 (or whatever address the server listens to).









Configuration
-------------------------------------------------
The following settings are currently supported:

| Setting        | Description           | Default  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| `projects_path` (string)      | The path where project folders are located | "" |
| `build_path` (string)      | The root path where artifacts will be placed       |   "" |
| `mounts` (object{string:string}) |  The paths from the host machine that should be mounted inside the execution containers     |    {} |

For a sample configuration file refer to [`config.sample.json`](cmd/mistryd/config.sample.json).
